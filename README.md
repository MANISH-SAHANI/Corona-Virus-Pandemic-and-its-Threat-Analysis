<h1 align="center"> ðŸ“ˆCorona Virus Pandemic and its Threat Analysis</h1>
 

## Context:
This DIY project is to work on the world's most sensitive situation that has occurred and analysis of data using Data Mining approaches to develop a model is absolutely necessary. This is based on the Corona Virus pandemic and its threat.

You are provided with 2 real life data-sets in the format of CSV files, called : 

covid_19_data.csv  &&  covid19_line_list_data_modified.

#### The fields of covid_19_data.csv are as follows:

1. SNo 

2. ObservationDate 

3. Province/State 

4. Country/Region 

5. Last Update 

6. Confirmed 

7. Deaths 

8. Recovered


[ All the fields are self explanatory from the name]


#### The fields of covid19_line_list_data_modified are as follows:

1. id

2. case_in_country

3. reporting date  

4. summary  

5. location 

6. country 

7. gender

8. age

9. symptom_onset  

10. If_onset_approximated  

11. hosp_visit_date  

12. exposure_start  

13. exposure_end

14. visiting Wuhan  

15. from Wuhan	  

16. death  

17. recovered  

18. symptom


[ All the fields are self explanatory from the name]



## Activities To Perform:

Perform the following activities on the dataset using Python Programming Language.You may use any Python libraries as may be needed to complete the operations.

```
      1) Clean, filter and Load data as necessary for analysis.
```

```
      2) Develop appropriate models using Clustering techniques.
```

```
      3) Use Data Analysis and mining techniques to develop solutions to queries :
                         a. Which is the highest affected area and what  is the number. Group from the model, the 
                            second highest affected area along with number.
                         b. What is the mortality Vs. recovery ratio.
                         c. Is there any general tendency towards particular age, gender or random?
                         d. What is the mortality rate among different age groups?
```

```
      4) Develop a simple User Interface including all the queries and processes above to make it a functional system.
```

## Here's the solution : 

For the above context, there is a Python ipynb file for the solution.

The Python ipynb file contains the code that was used to generate the results of analysis.

Additionally, the code in the Python ipynb file is well-structured, clearly commented, and organized in a logical fashion, making it easy for any user to understand and apply the code to their own data and projects.

```
                 You can just clone the repository or download the repository to have a look
```
